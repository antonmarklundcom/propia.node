/**
 * Report what the *production database* actually has, versus what the code
 * needs — the migration journal, the columns `src/db/schema.ts` declares, and
 * whether the D8 `owner` lead lane can be written.
 *
 * The migration list answers "did drizzle record running these?". That is a
 * proxy, and it can lie in both directions (below). **The question that
 * actually matters is "does this database have what the deployed code
 * selects?"** — because drizzle emits `SELECT` with every column in
 * `schema.ts` named, so one missing column 500s every page that reads that
 * table, not just the feature that added it. The schema-drift section answers
 * that one directly, by reading `schema.ts` and `information_schema` and
 * diffing them.
 *
 * Why this exists: `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` lists every migration the repo
 * has generated. It says nothing about which of them ran against prod. README
 * step 2 documents pasting a migration into phpMyAdmin as an accepted path, and
 * that path does **not** record a row in `__drizzle_migrations`. So the journal
 * and the tracking table can disagree in both directions, and `npm run
 * db:migrate` decides what to run from the tracking table alone. Look before
 * you fire — there is no staging environment.
 *
 * Strictly read-only by default: it opens its own connection, runs SELECTs
 * against information_schema, and prints. It never migrates and never writes.
 *
 *   $env:DATABASE_URL = "mysql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:3306/<db>"   # PowerShell
 *   npm run db:status
 *
 * With `--probe` it additionally tries one INSERT of a `routed_to = 'owner'`
 * lead inside a transaction and **always rolls it back**, which is the only
 * way to prove the enum accepts the value end to end. The rollback is in a
 * `finally`, so it happens even if the insert throws.
 *
 *   npm run db:status -- --probe
