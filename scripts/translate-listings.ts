/**
 * Fill `listings.title_en` / `description_en` from the Spanish source

 *
 *   DATABASE_URL="mysql://..." ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..." npm run cron:translate
 *   ... npm run cron:translate -- --dry            # what would run, no API calls
 *   ... npm run cron:translate -- --limit 25       # bound the spend of one run
 *   ... npm run cron:translate -- --id 1234        # one listing, ignores the hash
 *   ... npm run cron:translate -- --force          # re-translate everything
 *
 * **What needs translating** is decided by `translation_hash`: the sha256 of
 * the title and Spanish description the stored English was made from. A row
 * needs work when the hash is missing (never translated) or no longer matches
 * (the seller rewrote something). That is why the job can run on a schedule
 * and cost nothing on a quiet day, and why an edit is picked up without any
 * hook in the publish path — see src/lib/translate.ts for why there is no hook.
 *
 * Only `published` rows are translated: a draft is still being written, and a
 * removed listing is not on the English door either.
 *
 * **Failure is per row and never fatal.** A row that throws keeps its old hash,
 * so the next run tries it again; the run reports every failure and exits
 * non-zero if any occurred, so a cron that mails its output says something
 * went wrong without pretending the whole batch died.
