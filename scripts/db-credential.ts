/**
 * Pick the database credential a CLI run is allowed to use, before anything
 * opens a connection.
 *
 * **Import this first, above every other import, in any script that can write.**
 * `src/db/index.ts` builds its pool at module load from `process.env.DATABASE_URL`,
 * and that file is off-limits (`fable/plan.md` §1.3 — the app's own credential
 * handling is never rewritten). So the choice has to be made in the process
 * before that module is evaluated, and ES modules are evaluated in the order
 * their imports are declared: putting this line first is what makes it work.
 * Moving it below the runner import silently restores the old behaviour.
 *
 * The rule (`fable-plan-ops.md` §1.12):
 *
 * - `DATABASE_URL` is the **read-only** user. It is what an agent is given, and
 *   it is enough for `db:status` and for every `--dry` run.
 * - `DATABASE_URL_RW` is the owner user. It lives on Anton's machine only, is
 *   never given to an agent, and is used **only** when a run actually writes.
 *
 * With no `DATABASE_URL_RW` set, nothing changes: writing runs use
 * `DATABASE_URL`, which is how a single-credential machine has always worked.
