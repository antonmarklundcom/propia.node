 * Pre-launch disclosure (D6 / launch sequencing).

 * The site is publicly reachable on two domains before it holds real
 * inventory: the listing rows are seeded/imported samples and the photos are
 * still `picsum.photos` placeholders (PLAN.md). A visitor landing on a
 * polished-looking portal has no way to know that, and a listing that looks
 * like a real offer but isn't is the kind of thing that earns a complaint
 * rather than a lead. Hence a standing notice until real, permissioned
 * inventory is live.
 *
 * Flip `UNDER_CONSTRUCTION` to false (or set
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNDER_CONSTRUCTION=false` in the Hostinger env) on launch day —
 * one line, one deploy, no component to delete. It is a build-time constant,
 * so it needs the redeploy either way.
