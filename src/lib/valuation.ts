/**
 * Valuation estimate (ARCHITECTURE.md M7 — the seller-side lead magnet).
 *
 * Answers "¿cuánto vale mi casa?" from the medians the nightly job already
 * computes, and it is the only thing on the site that puts a number on a
 * property nobody has seen. So the rules here are about restraint:
 *
 *  1. **A range, never a single number.** A point estimate from a median price
 *     per m² would be false precision, and an owner who anchors on it and then
 *     lists 20% high sits unsold for months.
 *  2. **The band widens as the data thins.** With 60 comparable listings the
 *     range is tight; with 9 it is wide, because that is the truth.
 *  3. **Below MIN_RELIABLE_SAMPLE we refuse.** No estimate at all beats an
 *     estimate we would not defend — the form says so and offers a human.
 *  4. It is an asking-price estimate from *published* listings, not a closing
 *     price and not an official appraisal. The copy says that too.
