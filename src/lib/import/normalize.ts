 * The key is bucketed on purpose (5k USD, 10 m²) so a flat re-listed at a
 * slightly different price still collapses, and the phone is what stops those
 * coarse buckets from over-matching. Drop the phone and the key degenerates to
 * "price bucket + area bucket + location + operation + type" — which is a
 * perfect description of *every unit in the same building*. An agency
 * spreadsheet typically carries one phone for the whole agency or none at all,
 * so twenty 60 m² flats at $85k in Villa Morra hashed identically, and rows
 * 2–20 were silently absorbed into row 1 as extra `listing_sources` entries.
 * The import reported success and 200 rows became 40.
 *
 * A NULL key means "create it and let the review queue judge", which is the
 * recoverable failure. A false merge is not recoverable — the data is gone.
 *
 * `scopeAgencyId` keeps the fuzzy match inside one agency (0 = unscoped). Two
 * agencies co-broking the same property is a real thing, but resolving it by
 * silently folding agency B's listing into agency A's row would take listings
 * out of B's panel and misattribute B's leads. Cross-agency duplicates belong
 * in the review queue, not in a hash collision.
