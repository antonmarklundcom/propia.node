 * Brand naming, client-safe half. **The domain is the brand** (founder
 * decision, 2026-08-16) — there is no separate wordmark, so the name is
 * per-host config in `verticals.ts` rather than one global string.
 *
 * This module must never import `next/headers`, directly or transitively:
 * `src/i18n/es.ts` imports it, and six client components import that. The
 * request-scoped resolver therefore lives in `brand-server.ts`.
 *
 * Two ways in, and picking the wrong one is the mistake to avoid:
 *
 * - `brandName()` from `@/lib/brand-server` — async, request-scoped, correct
 *   on every public page. Use it anywhere a visitor sees the result.
 * - `BRAND_NAME` below — the CANONICAL_HOST's brand, resolved once at module
 *   load. Only correct where the host cannot vary or does not matter: /admin
 *   and /agencia (staff surfaces reached on one host), client components, and
 *   scripts. On a public page it pins that page to one domain's name no
 *   matter which domain the visitor actually typed.
